# Multiple Linear Regression

This project presents an implementation of multiple linear regression, an essential algorithm in machine learning that examines the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable for accurate predictions. In this project, we aim to find a best-fit plane or hyperplane that minimizes error between predicted and actual values, ensuring our model can make precise predictions effectively.

# Project Overview

Multiple linear regression models the relationship between two or more independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). The primary goal is to identify a linear relationship that best fits the observed data points, enabling predictions of the target variable based on multiple feature inputs. By minimizing the residual sum of squares (difference between observed and predicted values), the model calculates coefficients for each predictor, defining a best-fit hyperplane that accurately captures this relationship.

# Objective

To create and train a multiple linear regression model that captures the trends within a dataset involving multiple features, establishing a best-fit hyperplane. To make accurate predictions for future data points by applying the learned relationships between multiple features and the target variable.

# Today's Work

Implemented multiple linear regression using Python and relevant libraries. Explored and preprocessed a dataset to ensure high data quality for optimal model performance. Trained the model on the dataset, optimizing for minimal prediction error. Visualized predicted values against actual values to assess the model's fit and effectiveness in capturing data trends.
