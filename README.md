# Multiple-Linear-Regression
Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique that models the relationship between two or more independent variables and a continuous dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It estimates the impact of each predictor on the outcome, allowing for the prediction of the dependent variable based on multiple inputs.
